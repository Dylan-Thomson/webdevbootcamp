##Command Line Basics Exercise

* Make a new folder named "Animals"
* Inside of "Animals" add two directories: "AwesomeAnimals" and "SketchyAnimals"
* Inside of "AwesomeAnimals" add the following files: "Capybara.js", "ArticFox.html", and "TreeFrog.txt"
* Inside of "SketchyAnimals" add the folowing files: "BrownRecluse.html" and "BulletAnt.js"
* Inside of "SketchyAnimals" create a "Snakes" directory.
* Inside the "Snakes" director create the following files: "Cobra.css" and "ReticulatedPython.py"
* You have a change of heart and decide that Bullet Ants are no longer sketchy. Remove the "BulletAnt.js" file
* All animal life goes extinct. Delete the entire "Animals" directory

**BONUS: See if you can do this without ever changing directories(without using cd)**
