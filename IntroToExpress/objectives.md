#Introduction to Express

* What is a framework? How is it different from a library?
    * Inversion of control
    * Both are external code you can include in your application
    * You call a library, but the framework calls you
    * Think of a framework like mad libs, where you fill in the missing parts
* What is Express?
    * Web development framework for Node
    * Other frameworks: Flask, Rails, Sails
* Why are we using Express?
    * Most popular Node framework - big community
    * Very lightweight (lots of blanks to fill in on your own)
    * As opposed to Rails which is heavyweight (it does a lot for you)
    * Lightweight means we will learn a lot more about how things work
